## Understanding Variables and Shell Commands

### Variables
* **Variables** are named containers for storing data.
* You assign values to variables using the equal sign (`=`).
* To use a variable's value, you prefix its name with a dollar sign (`$`).

**Example:**
```bash
name="Alice"
greeting="Hello, $name!"
echo $greeting
```
This would output:
```
Hello, Alice!
```

**Explanation:**
* The `echo` command is used to print text to the terminal.
* The variables `bankname`, `founded`, and `ceo` are enclosed in double quotes (`"`) to ensure proper expansion.
* The dollar sign (`$`) before each variable name tells the shell to replace the variable with its value.

**Key Points:**
* Double quotes preserve spaces and special characters within variables.
* Single quotes (`'`) prevent variable expansion, treating everything as literal text.

By using variables and the `echo` command, you've created a dynamic sentence that can be easily modified by changing the variable values.
