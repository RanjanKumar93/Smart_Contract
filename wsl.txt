The provided text doesn't contain actual code for installing WSL, but it outlines the steps with explanations. Here's a breakdown with some example commands:

**Installation Process:**

1. **Check Windows Version:** (This isn't code, but verification)
    - Open the Start menu and type "winver".
    - This will show your Windows version and build number. You need Windows 10 or 11 for WSL 2.

2. **Run Windows Update:** (This isn't code, but an action)
    - Open the Start menu and type "Windows update".
    - Click on "Windows Update Settings" and check for updates.
    - Install any updates and restart your computer if prompted.

3. **Install WSL with Command Prompt:**
    - Open the Start menu and type "cmd.exe".
    - Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".
    - Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    wsl --install
    ```

    - This command enables WSL, downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel (core), and sets WSL 2 as the default version. It might also install Ubuntu automatically.
    - You may need to restart your computer.

4. **Confirm WSL Installation:** (This verifies the installation)
    - Open Command Prompt again.
    - Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    wsl -l -v
    ```

    - This command lists all installed WSL distributions and their versions. You should see Ubuntu or another distro you chose.

5. **Setting Up Ubuntu Distro:** (This isn't code, but an interactive setup)
    - After restarting (if prompted), you might see an "Ubuntu" window open automatically. If not, search for "Ubuntu" in the Start menu and launch it.
    - The Ubuntu window will prompt you to set a username and password. Choose a memorable username (lowercase by default in Ubuntu) and password.
    - Once logged in, you'll see a Linux terminal. Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    echo "Hello world"
    ```

    - You should see "Hello world" printed on the screen. This confirms a successful setup.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter an error about "A required feature is not installed," you might need to enable Hyper-V (Virtualization) in your Windows Features settings. Refer to the provided guide or online resources for detailed steps. 

**Additional Notes:**

- The `wsl` command is used to manage WSL distributions.
- The `echo` command is a simple command used to print text to the console.

This explanation provides a clearer understanding of the installation process without actual code execution (except for basic verification commands). Remember, running the `wsl --install` command requires administrator privileges.
