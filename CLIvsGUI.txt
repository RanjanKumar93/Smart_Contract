## CLI vs. GUI

### Understanding the Terms
* **CLI (Command Line Interface):** A text-based way to interact with your computer using commands.
* **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** A visual interface using icons, menus, and windows for interaction.

### Examples

**Imagine you want to create a new folder named "Documents" on your desktop.**

#### Using a GUI:
1. Open your file explorer.
2. Navigate to your desktop.
3. Right-click on an empty space.
4. Select "New" -> "Folder".
5. Type "Documents" and press Enter.

#### Using a CLI:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `mkdir Documents` and press Enter.

**As you can see, the CLI method is much quicker and more direct once you know the command.**

### Other Examples of CLI Commands
* **Listing files and directories:** `ls`
* **Changing directories:** `cd`
* **Copying files:** `cp`
* **Moving files:** `mv`
* **Deleting files:** `rm`
* **Creating a new file:** `touch`

### Why Use a CLI?
While GUIs are generally user-friendly, CLIs offer several advantages:
* **Speed:** Tasks can be performed much faster with CLI commands.
* **Precision:** CLIs allow for exact control over actions.
* **Automation:** Scripts can be written to automate repetitive tasks.
* **Power:** CLIs offer a deeper level of interaction with the system.

**Remember:**
* The `mkdir` command stands for "make directory".
